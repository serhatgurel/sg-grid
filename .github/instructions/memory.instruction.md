# Session preferences

- Allow automated web fetches/searches for research when requested.
- Follow the three instruction files under `.github/instructions/` (`general-coding-standards.instructions.md`, `self-explanatory-code-commenting.instructions.md`, `vuejs3.instructions.md`) for the rest of this session.
- the test command is `npm run test:run --silent`
- After each task is completed (tests pass and the demo/playground is updated to show the new capability), update the corresponding item in `docs/tasks/development-order-filter-sort.md` and then update this memory file to reflect progress for the rest of the session.
- I will manually commit changes after I perform code review of all code, tests and demo changes; do not auto-commit on my behalf.
- When updating `docs/tasks/development-order-filter-sort.md` for task completion, only check the box for the completed item (no additional commit/trace metadata in the checklist).
- After each task is completed, summarize progress in the "Progress (session)" section below.
- when you update either the progress section in this file or the checklist in `docs/tasks/development-order-filter-sort.md`, run a check and remove duplicate entries if any.
