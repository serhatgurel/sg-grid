- Target release: 31-12-2025

## Team goals and business objectives

Business needs a simple, efficient way to manage and visualize tabular data. This project aims to streamline data handling, improve accessibility, and provide an easy-to-extend grid component for applications.

## Background and strategic fit

The grid aligns with the company's goal to treat data as a first-class asset by improving how teams view, edit, and export data for operational and analytical tasks.

## Assumptions

- Developers need a lightweight, well-typed grid that's easy to add to projects and extend.
- End users need a responsive, accessible grid with fast load times for large datasets.

## Overview: structure and priorities

User stories below are grouped and reprioritized into MUST, SHOULD, and COULD categories to help scope an MVP and phased delivery.

### MUST (MVP scope)

These are baseline features required for a first usable release.

1. As a user, I want filter and sort so I can find information quickly.
2. As a user, I want pagination with configurable page size and client/server paging so I can navigate large datasets.
3. As a user, I want selection modes (none, single, multi) and persistence across paging so I can operate on rows.
4. As a user, I want editing modes (none, inline, popup) with validation so I can correct data safely.
5. As a developer, I want easy installation (npm/yarn/pnpm) and simple initialization so I can add the grid quickly.
6. As a developer, I want first-class TypeScript typings and clear public APIs for discoverability.
7. As a user, I want support for common column data types (string, number, date/time timezone-aware, boolean, link, image) and custom cell templates.
8. As a user, I want accessibility basics: keyboard navigation and screen-reader labels.
9. As a developer, I want a minimal example app demonstrating components, editing modes, paging, and integration patterns so I can prototype rapidly.

### SHOULD (important, next-phase)

These improve developer experience and advanced user workflows.

10. As a user, I want grouping and aggregations (count, sum, avg, min, max) and a summary row.
11. As a user, I want bulk-edit and batch actions for multiple selected rows.
12. As a user, I want conditional formatting and custom renderers.
13. As a developer, I want theming hooks (CSS variables / token-based), style isolation options, and clear style hooks so the grid matches app design systems.
14. As a developer, I want plugin/extension API and lifecycle hooks/events for extensibility.
15. As a developer, I want test fixtures, unit/integration tests, and CI configuration.

### COULD (nice to have, later)

Lower-priority features and large-surface items to consider for future releases.

16. As a user, I want streaming/push-updated rows and conflict-resolution strategies for concurrent edits.
17. As a user, I want offline/cached access and sync with merge rules.
18. As a user, I want real-time collaboration features and notifications.
19. As a user, I want advanced import/export (Excel/PDF) and print-friendly reports.
20. As a developer, I want debug/logging hooks and runtime warnings for misconfiguration.
21. As a developer, I want stable semantic versioning, a deprecation policy, and automated release tooling.

### UI, panels & small control stories (scoped)

These are component-level behaviors; include them across phases depending on priority.

22. As a user, I want panels (filter/search/column chooser/grid panel) to be positionable and collapsible.
23. As a user, I want a configurable search panel with placeholder, debounce, and scope (global/local).
24. As a user, I want visual/display options exposed (row numbers, alignment, ellipsis, wrap text, border toggles, fonts, CSS hooks).
25. As a user, I want the column chooser to optionally preserve original column order when toggling visibility.
26. As a user, I want filter controls to support inline row or panel modes with clearable inputs and debounce.
27. As a user, I want paging controls to be individually configurable (showGotoPage, showJumpToStart/End, showNext/Prev).
28. As a developer, I want columns to accept local data-sources and mapping props (data-source on column, data-id, data-value, text-field, key-field).
29. As a user, I want contextual tooltips and per-column or per-grid loading indicators.

### Code quality, CI & documentation

30. As a developer, I want automated CI pipelines that run lint, type-checks, unit tests, and security scans on every PR.
31. As a developer, I want pre-commit hooks (format, lint), a code-style config, and contributor onboarding docs.
32. As a developer, I want generated API documentation published and versioned per release.

## Implementation guidance (suggested)

This section gives pragmatic guidance for the first implementation phases (MVP → SHOULD → COULD).

- Architecture
  - Implement the grid as a set of small, focused Vue 3 components (presentational + composables). Keep public APIs thin and typed.
  - Separate data layer (data-source adapters) from rendering and UI concerns. Provide client-side and server-side paging adapters.

- Theming & styles
  - Use CSS custom properties (tokens) for theme primitives. Provide a `src/styles/tokens.css` with defaults and a runtime helper to apply a token map per-grid.
  - Prefer scoped component styles and clearly prefixed class names (`.sg-grid`, `.sg-grid__row`, `.sg-grid__cell`) to minimize collisions.
  - Offer an optional Web Component / Shadow DOM wrapper for strict isolation in host apps that need it.

- Extensibility
  - Design lifecycle hooks and events (data-load, edit-start, edit-commit, edit-conflict, selection-change) and document them.
  - Provide a plugin registration API for adding column types, cell renderers, and editor templates.

- Diagnostics & logging
  - Implement a small logger adapter with a safe default; allow consumers to provide a custom logger or subscribe to diagnostics events.
  - Validate critical props at mount and emit structured warnings (code + message + suggested fix).

- Testing & quality
  - Start with unit tests for composables and critical utilities using Vitest. Add component tests with @vue/test-utils.
  - Add a small visual smoke test of the example app to CI (run in headless browser) once Storybook or the example app exists.

- Packaging & DX
  - Develop with local linking so examples import the local source. Provide `package.json` scripts: `dev`, `build`, `test`, `example`.
  - Publish TypeScript declarations and include a minimal changelog and contribution guide.

## Suggested MVP (concise)

Goal: deliver a stable, usable grid that teams can adopt quickly.

MVP feature set (target initial release):

- Core grid rendering and virtualized rows (basic performance)
- Sorting and column filtering (per-column simple filters)
- Client- and server-side paging adapters (configurable pageSize)
- Selection modes (none, single, multi) with persistence across pages
- Editing: inline and popup editors with basic validation
- Column types: string, number, date (timezone-aware), boolean, link, image, and custom cell template support
- Accessibility: keyboard navigation and ARIA labels for screen readers
- TypeScript typings and a minimal example app (examples/minimal)
- Basic theming via CSS variables, and stable class-name style hooks
- Tests: unit tests for composables + a smoke test for the example app

MVP non-goals (explicit)

- No real-time streaming or offline sync in MVP
- No enterprise collaboration or telemetry by default
- Complex export (PDF, Excel advanced) postponed to post-MVP

## Milestones & timelines (suggested)

- Sprint 0 (2 weeks): scaffolding, component architecture, tokens, dev examples, and CI setup.
- Sprint 1 (2–3 weeks): core rendering, basic paging, selection, sorting, and example app.
- Sprint 2 (2–3 weeks): editing (inline/popup), validation, basic tests, and theming.
- Sprint 3 (2 weeks): accessibility fixes, docs, more tests, and a public example with server paging mock.

## Acceptance & verification

- Acceptance tests cover: basic grid render, sorting/filtering, paging behavior, selection persistence, editing flows, and example app smoke-run.
- Code review policy: PRs must include unit tests for new behavior, and examples/docs updates where relevant.

## Questions & decisions to track

- Which browser/IE support baseline do we target? (modern evergreen recommended)
- Do we provide a Shadow DOM build by default or as an opt-in wrapper?
- Telemetry/telemetry providers policy (opt-in only).

## What we're not doing (explicit)

- Large-scale real-time collaboration, offline sync, and advanced export formats are out of MVP scope.
