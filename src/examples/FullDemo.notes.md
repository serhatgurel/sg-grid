FullDemo Notes

This demo shows both declarative and data-driven usage of `SgGrid`.

Purpose

- Provide a single example that demonstrates most features once implemented.
- Show declarative columns using `<SgColumn>` and a data-driven `columns` prop example.
- Exercise nested field paths (arrays and objects), field functions, and array-join helpers.

Usage

- Open `FullDemo.vue` in the examples directory or select "Full Demo" from the app example selector.
- The declarative grid shows a subset of rows; the data-driven grid shows additional columns and examples of field functions.

Notes for maintainers

- Keep this file next to the demo so it can be edited alongside the example.
- Consider rendering this markdown as HTML if richer formatting is needed.
